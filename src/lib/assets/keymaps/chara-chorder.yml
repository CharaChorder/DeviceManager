  538:
    id: "SPUR"
    title: Spurring Toggle
    icon: piano
    description: |
      'Chording only' mode which tells your device to output chords on a press rather than a press & release.
      It also enables you to jump from one chord to another without releasing everything and can be activated
      in GTM or by chording both mirror keys. It can provide significant speed gains with chording,
      but also takes away the flexibility of character entry.
      Spurring also helps new users learn how to chord by eliminating the need to focus on timing.
      Spurring is toggled by chording both of the 'mirror' keys together.

      Any new chords created while a dynamic library is active are established one level above its seed.
